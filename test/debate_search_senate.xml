            <body>I will take that interjection. I think most Australians would ask that question. Most Australians would believe, from watching Senator &lt;span class=&quot;hi&quot;&gt;Minchin&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s behaviour and that of others, that you are not going to be for changing. No amount of fact, detail or evidence is going to change your minds. You do not believe that this is something that this nation needs to do, notwithstanding the fact that...</body>

            <body>...Ludwig and O&amp;#8217;Brien, who have been responsible for the very difficult job of getting the government&amp;#8217;s legislation through and managing this chamber in a minority position. To Senator &lt;span class=&quot;hi&quot;&gt;Minchin&lt;/span&gt;, the minor parties and the independents, I wish them all an enjoyable break. I hope they get time to spend with their families. I thank you, Mr President.</body>

            <body>Thank you very much, Mr President. I rise to concur with the remarks given by Senator Evans, you, Senator &lt;span class=&quot;hi&quot;&gt;Minchin&lt;/span&gt; and Senator Brown.

Unfortunately, as it has devolved more into a party political...</body>

It was something my mother was complaining about when I last spoke to her&amp;#8212;how hot and unseasonable it had been. I note Senator &lt;span class=&quot;hi&quot;&gt;Minchin&lt;/span&gt; interjected on your question, suggesting that this was not a record and that these temperatures had been observed in 1961. I do not know whether that is true or not. I certainly know it...</body>

            <body>...ask the question is simply wrong. But that is not what we are discussing today. Today we are discussing the CPRS bills that are before us. I commend the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate Nick &lt;span class=&quot;hi&quot;&gt;Minchin&lt;/span&gt; for pointing out earlier what a misnomer &amp;#8216;CPRS legislation&amp;#8217; is. I also commend him on his speech to the chamber. The interesting thing is that when we go out there into the...</body>
