            <body>...consistent with what we have had on earlier occasions, an attempt by the Leader of the Opposition to embroil my staff in this matter. I seem to remember what he did during the forged email affair on &lt;span class=&quot;hi&quot;&gt;Utegate&lt;/span&gt;, which was to seek to embroil the economic adviser in my office, Dr Charlton. Once again, we are going down the same road.</body>

He said it once before, this year, and that was in relation to the &lt;span class=&quot;hi&quot;&gt;Utegate&lt;/span&gt; affair, which was based on a forged email. My question to the Leader of the Opposition when he stands to his feet next time is: will he provide to us the evidence upon which he has based this...</body>

What we had last time was, of course, the forged email affair around &lt;span class=&quot;hi&quot;&gt;Utegate&lt;/span&gt; when the Leader of the Opposition stood up and made an accusation publicly that I had misled the parliament on the basis of no evidence at all, which perhaps explains why he was...</body>

Then they stand up and move suspensions and censures. Remember &lt;span class=&quot;hi&quot;&gt;Utegate&lt;/span&gt; week? They did not move anything on the Monday and they waited until the Wednesday, when we knew it was a fake email, and then moved a censure motion. That was a highlight of the tactical...</body>

They will talk about anything other than utes, because the reality is that, apart from the good people of Deniliquin, and then for only one weekend a year, no-one cares about the &lt;span class=&quot;hi&quot;&gt;Utegate&lt;/span&gt; affair. Nobody really cares about utes the way those opposite do. We could have dealt with this a long way back, at the very start of this week in parliament, if the Leader of the...</body>
