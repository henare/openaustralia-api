            <body>...consistent with what we have had on earlier occasions, an attempt by the Leader of the Opposition to embroil my staff in this matter. I seem to remember what he did during the forged email affair on &lt;span class=&quot;hi&quot;&gt;Utegate&lt;/span&gt;, which was to seek to embroil the economic adviser in my office, Dr Charlton. Once again, we are going down the same road.</body>

He said it once before, this year, and that was in relation to the &lt;span class=&quot;hi&quot;&gt;Utegate&lt;/span&gt; affair, which was based on a forged email. My question to the Leader of the Opposition when he stands to his feet next time is: will he provide to us the evidence upon which he has based this...</body>

What we had last time was, of course, the forged email affair around &lt;span class=&quot;hi&quot;&gt;Utegate&lt;/span&gt; when the Leader of the Opposition stood up and made an accusation publicly that I had misled the parliament on the basis of no evidence at all, which perhaps explains why he was...</body>
